Reflection (1-2 paragraphs):  I have been away with work so its taken me longer than I wouldve liked to even start this class. Took me about an hour to even set up 
looking at the website. I did enjoy the process but it took me a good amount of time as it should. There were some really confusing pieces here and there 
but I feel like Ill be able to work through them and do better. Thank you so much for the opportunity to be in this class.

            The Insperation for this song came from my wife.<br> 
            She likes to randomly sing sometimes and I find it entertaining.<br> 
            This group of ramblings just so happened to be a haiku!<br>

        One of my all time favorite things in the world is cooking. I cook pretty much everyday wether its at home or work. MY wife loves all the food and rates them in a little notebook so I Know what to make her next.
        <br><br>
        I also Love video games. Both playing and creating them has been a big part of my life since I was young. I have wokred more on it recently then I have in the past and I feel my talents are really imporiving in multiple fields!
        <br><br>
        I like to hang out with my family, especially with my beautiful wife. We go on walks and watch tv together and we are excited to have a baby girl on the way. If I asnt busy before then I definetly will be soon!
